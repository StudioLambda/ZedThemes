# Zed Themes

The lambda studio zed themes are a set of minimalist themes
for Zed that are designed to be easy to read with tones of
purple that resemble those on the default XCode editor.

This theme is possible thanks to the great work of
[Shawn Lukas](https://shawnlukas.com) on the [Onyx Theme](https://theme.shawnlukas.com/).
